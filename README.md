## 📖 Component Details

### 1. Modelbase: 3D Fire Evacuation Training Simulator

An interactive web-based training application built with React and Three.js that simulates fire evacuation scenarios in a 3D building environment.

**Features:**
- Realistic 3D building models (Gates Hillman Center, CMU campus)
- AI-generated fire scenarios with dynamic hazard evolution
- First-person and third-person camera views
- Navigation graph with pathfinding
- Safety evaluation and performance feedback
- Scenario-based decision making

**Key Components:**
- `GatesBuilding.tsx` - 3D building model with multiple floors
- `ScenarioEngine` - Manages fire scenarios and game state
- `Pathfinder` - A* pathfinding for navigation
- `SafetyEvaluator` - Evaluates player decisions

**Tech Stack:**
- React 19, Three.js, React Three Fiber, TypeScript, Vite

### 2. LocationDetector: Indoor Localization Service

A Python/FastAPI service that processes smartphone camera frames to extract semantic metadata for indoor localization. Uses Overshoot Vision API to identify scene types, landmarks, and readable text.

**Features:**
- Environment classification (hallway, room, lobby, stairwell, etc.)
- Landmark detection (doors, stairs, elevators, exit signs)
- Text recognition (room numbers, floor indicators)
- Spatial cues (direction and distance)
- Quality metrics (confidence scores, lighting conditions)

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /extract` - Process single camera frame
- `POST /extract/batch` - Process multiple frames
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /schema` - Get JSON schema

**Example Usage:**

```python
import httpx

async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
    with open('camera_frame.jpg', 'rb') as f:
        response = await client.post(
            'http://localhost:8000/extract',
            files={'file': f}
        )
    metadata = response.json()
    print(f"Scene: {metadata['scene_type']}")
    print(f"Landmarks: {metadata['landmarks']}")
```

**Tech Stack:**
- Python 3.9+, FastAPI, Pydantic, HTTPX, Pillow

### 3. Live-Escape: Real-Time Emergency Guidance

A real-time emergency evacuation guidance system that processes live video streams to provide optimal evacuation routes. Uses Overshoot API for video analysis and WebSocket for real-time communication.

**Features:**
- Real-time video stream processing

- Edges represent navigable paths
- Dynamic path blocking based on fire/smoke

### Scenario Engine
- Time-based fire spread
- Dynamic hazard evolution
- Player position tracking
- Safety evaluation
